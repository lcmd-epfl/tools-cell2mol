    <i><b>cell2mol</b></i>, interprets crystallographic data and retrieves the connectivity and total charge of molecular                   
        complexes and their components including the oxidation state (OS) of metal atoms and the charge of ligands.               
        This interface interprets any cif. file and generates an output file containing the charge and the xyz coordinates        
        of any molecular component isolated or within the unit cell to make it ready for quantum chemical computations.
