    <i><b>cell2mol</b></i> interprets crystallographic data and retrieves the connectivity, total charge, and spin of molecular                   
        complexes and their components including the oxidation state (OS) of metal atoms and the charge of ligands.               
        This interface interprets any <i>.cif</i> or <i>.info</i> file (created with cif2cell), and generates an output file 
        containing the charge, spin, and the xyz coordinates of any molecular component isolated to make it ready for 
        quantum chemical computations.
