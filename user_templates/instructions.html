        If the input file was imported and interpreted successfully, you will be able to view basic structure information under 
        the <strong><samp>Structure information</samp></strong> tab. Press <strong><samp>Run cell2mol</samp></strong> and wait. 
        The waiting time depends on the structure size and complexity.

        If the structure was analyzed successfully, you will be able to view its analysis under the <strong><samp>Structure analysis</strong></samp>
        tab. You can download the cell object in <i>.gmol</i> format by pressing <strong><samp>Download cell (.gmol)</strong></samp>. 
        Press <strong><samp>View structure</strong></samp> to view, interact and download specific molecules or complexes.
    </li>

    <li>
        By double-clicking  on the 3d structure you will be able to zoom in, zoom out, and rotate the model. On the left column,  
        you can select which molecular components (ligands, molecules, or metals) are displayed. Below the 3d structure, you will find a toggle 
        button to select if you want to view the cell or one mol (molecule or complex). When mol is selected, you can use the 
        dropdown menu to choose one to visualize. The xyz file of the selected mol containing
        charge, spin, and cartesian coordinates (ready for quantum chemical calculations), can be downloaded by clicking <strong><samp>Download selected 
        mol (.xyz)</strong></samp>.

If one of the steps fail, please verify your input file or try to use a different cif2cell version if using info file as input.
